# Gunther's Garden Planner
Gunther's Garden Planner is designed to help you find information about potential crops you maybe interested in growing in your garden. In the future, it will include growing tips and companion plants (plants that do well growing together in a garden bed) for your searched crop. Once you decide you want to add a plant to your garden, you can save it and add it to your virtual garden to remember what you want to grow.
